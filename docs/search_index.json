There is one chapter in this companion for each chapter of Mastering Metrics (hereinafter “MM”). Each chapter starts with a summary of that chapter’s econometric technique. Most chapters include replication of the empirical examples found in MM. Specifically, everything that is replicated in the MM R Package (Arnold 2020) is replicated here, along with additional explanations of that code. That package is also used for obtaining the data needed to replicate MM. The references .bib file was also populated using the references file from that package. Following the discussion and replication of MM, for chapters 1 (RCT), 3 (IV), 4 (RD), and 5 (DD), I found a paper that utilizes the econometric technique from that chapter. Chapters 3 (IV), 4 (RD), and 5 (DD) also include replication of papers using the econometric techniques. References "],

Show both your code and the output in the output (for all code chunks in the BP). Also include explanations of the results (and how the results relate to this chapter’s econometric technique) 1.2.1.1 SubSub section Note that you can also add subsubsections too to keep things organized 1.3 Example: (short description of your example) Find a journal article from the economics (or closely related) academic literature that utilizes this econometric technique. Include here a brief summary of the paper (add a formal citation by adding it to references.bib and @ referencing it here…tip: use Google Scholar to export a BiBTeX citation and paste it into references.bib). Please put a copy of the PDF file in the pdf folder (the first time you’ll need to create a pdf folder in the main project directory). 1.3.1 Results Include a (clear) screenshot of a main results table and explain key results. Remember the idea is to demonstrate usage of this chapter’s econometric technique. Make sure to include necessary information to understand the model corresponding with the results shown in the table (include an equation if it helps, include summary statistics if that helps).

First, include a summary of the paper. Explain enough so if you look at this again in a year, you’ll remember what the paper is about and the main results. 3.4.1 Data Part of replication is getting the data set up. Set it up here, explaining what you’re doing in each code chunk. Remember that all data is either read in from a URL (if it’s quick) or goes in the “data” folder (and the data folder is not pushed up to GitHub…just put the data manually in the folder and anyone else using the repo has to do the same thing on their computer). Include a table of summary statistics for variables you’ll use in the regressions. 3.4.2 Regressions Explain the details of the model (include an equation if it’s helpful), estimate the model, and display the results. Explain what you’re doing with your code and explain the results. If anything doesn’t match exactly with the paper, mention it (and explain why if you know). 3.4.3 Maps For the Settler Mortality paper, you should also include 3 choropleth maps: Settler Mortality (the instrument) Institutional Quality (average protection against expropriation risk, the endogenous variable) Log GDP (the outcome) Explain briefly what we see in the three maps and how they demonstrate the IV model. You can use leaflet and make interactive maps (like you did in 380, and I included as an example in the Bookdown Example). If you prefer you can use a different package. References "],
