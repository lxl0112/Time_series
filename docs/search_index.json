If the time series data has multiplicative structure, we can model it by using transformations. 1.3.1 Log Transformation \\[log(X_t)=log(m_t\\cdot s_t\\cdot e_t)=log(m_t)+log(s_t)+log(e_t)\\] Use to stablize variance, make seasonal effect \\(s_t\\) additive, &amp; make the data normally distributed. 1.3.2 Box-Cox Transformation \\[ y_t=(x_t^\\lambda-1)/\\lambda \\space\\space \\lambda\\ne0\\] \\[ or \\space y_t=ln(x_t) \\space\\space \\lambda=0\\] where \\(\\lambda\\) is a tuning parameter chosen by the analyst 1.4 Time Series Properties 1.4.1 Mean function (if mean is constant) \\[\\mu_t=E[X_t]\\] \\[\\hat \\mu=\\frac 1n\\sum_{t=1}^{n}x_t\\] In case of walking average, see ch.2 1.4.2 Variance function (if variance is constant) \\[\\sigma_t^2=Var[X_t]=E[X_t^2]-E[X_t]^2\\] \\[\\hat \\sigma^2=\\frac1{n-1} \\sum_{t=1}^n{(x_t-\\hat\\mu)^2}\\] 1.4.3 Autocovariance function (ACVF): \\[\\gamma_{s,t}=Cov[X_s,X_t]=E[X_sX_t]-E[X_t]E[X_s]\\] where \\(\\gamma_{t,t}=Cov[X_t,X_t]=Var[X_t]=\\sigma_t^2\\) Real data: \\[\\gamma_\\tau=Cov[X_tX_{t+\\tau}]\\] with lag \\(\\tau=0,1,2,..\\) 1.4.4 Autocorrelation function (ACF): \\[\\rho_{s,t}=Corr[X_s,X_t]=\\frac{Cov[X_s,X_t]}{\\sqrt{Var[X_s]Var[X_t]}}=\\frac{\\gamma_{s,t}}{\\sigma_s\\sigma_t}\\] where \\(\\rho_{t,t}=Corr[X_t,X_t]=1\\) Real data: \\[\\rho_\\tau=Corr[X_tX_{t+\\tau}]=\\frac{Cov[X_t,X_{t+\\tau}]}{\\sqrt{Var[X_t]Var[X_{t+\\tau}]}}=\\frac{\\gamma_\\tau}{\\gamma_0}\\] 1.4.5 Properties Property 1: \\(\\rho_\\tau=\\rho_{-\\tau}\\) Property 2: \\(|\\rho_\\tau|\\leq1\\) Property 3: Invertibility is not assumed 1.5 Stationarity A time series process \\(\\{X_t|t\\in T\\}\\) is strictly stationary if the joint distribution \\(f(X_{t1},...,X_{tk})\\) is identical to the joint distribution \\(f(X_{t1+r},...,X_{tk+r})\\) for all collections \\(t_1,...,t_k\\) and separation values \\(r\\). In other words, shifting the time origin of the series by \\(r\\) has no effect on its joint distribution. A time series process \\(\\{X_t|t\\in T\\}\\) is weakly stationary (or second-order stationary) if 1, mean function is constant and finite; 2, variance function is constant and finite; 3, autocovariance and autocorrelation functions only depend on the lag.

Show both your code and the output in the output (for all code chunks in the BP). Also include explanations of the results (and how the results relate to this chapter’s econometric technique) 3.2.1.1 SubSub section Note that you can also add subsubsections too to keep things organized (here and in the other sections…they might be helpful for the replications in particular) 3.3 Example: (short description of your example) Find a journal article from the economics (or closely related) academic literature that utilizes this econometric technique. Include here a brief summary of the paper (add a formal citation by adding it to references.bib and @ referencing it here…tip: use Google Scholar to export a BiBTeX citation and paste it into references.bib). Please put a copy of the PDF file in the pdf folder (the first time you’ll need to create a pdf folder in the main project directory). 3.3.1 Results Include a (clear) screenshot of a main results table and explain key results. Remember the idea is to demonstrate usage of this chapter’s econometric technique. Make sure to include necessary information to understand the model corresponding with the results shown in the table (include an equation if it helps, include summary statistics if that helps). 3.4 Replication: Settler Mortality and Development This subsection includes a replication of “The colonial origins of comparative development: An empirical investigation” (Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001). First, include a summary of the paper. Explain enough so if you look at this again in a year, you’ll remember what the paper is about and the main results. 3.4.1 Data Part of replication is getting the data set up. Set it up here, explaining what you’re doing in each code chunk. Remember that all data is either read in from a URL (if it’s quick) or goes in the “data” folder (and the data folder is not pushed up to GitHub…just put the data manually in the folder and anyone else using the repo has to do the same thing on their computer). Include a table of summary statistics for variables you’ll use in the regressions. 3.4.2 Regressions Explain the details of the model (include an equation if it’s helpful), estimate the model, and display the results. Explain what you’re doing with your code and explain the results. If anything doesn’t match exactly with the paper, mention it (and explain why if you know). 3.4.3 Maps For the Settler Mortality paper, you should also include 3 choropleth maps: Settler Mortality (the instrument) Institutional Quality (average protection against expropriation risk, the endogenous variable) Log GDP (the outcome) Explain briefly what we see in the three maps and how they demonstrate the IV model. You can use leaflet and make interactive maps (like you did in 380, and I included as an example in the Bookdown Example). If you prefer you can use a different package. "],
