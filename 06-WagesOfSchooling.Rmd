Brief explanation of what's going on in this chapter


## Replication of MM Examples

### Add subsection for each part of the replication

You can use the code from [@mmRpackage] to replicate all tables and/or figures, along with additional explanations of what each part of the code is doing. Show both your code and the output in the output (for all code chunks in the BP). Also include explanations of the results (and how the results relate to this chapter's econometric technique)
